# SWIFTSHARE
A python based file sharing tool designed to share files via the same network.

SwiftShare is a file-sharing tool. 
Why did we decide to create one more file-sharing system? The answer to that is that SwiftShare has some unique properties, which distinguish it from other existing systems.
First, our app SwiftShare is designed for people who know each other and are using the same Wi-Fi network.
Second, it frequently occurs that we want to download or share a file with a friend or co-worker but are unable to do so owing to poor internet, a broken Bluetooth system, or even its absence. 
Our application will be helpful in this situation since it will make advantage of the Wi-Fi networks of both devices and enable file sharing between them.
So it is quite challenging and fun to create a file transfer app using Python language. 
Python is a high-level language which is easy to use and is used in developing apps, used in machine learning, data science and many more areas.
We are going to transfer the files using the generated QRCode that contains the IP address and port number. 
The QR code will provide an improved user experience as the user will not have to put the IP address or any other content. 
Just scan the QR code and share files seamlessly.
